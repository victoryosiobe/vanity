# vanity/sol

**This folder will generate wallets for the SOL chain.**

> [!INFO]
>
> Solana wallets addresses, are case sensitive. So, vanity will become case sensitve on your inputs, here.
>
> Generation is extremely fast as we skip generation of mnemonics, and generate Keypairs directly. They are headless wallets, and this is why you see the keys in base58 format.
